- 👋 Hi, I’m @ConnorOBS
- 👀 I’m interested in developing domains I purchased from Google Domains a few years ago. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the basics of html and css, guided by my previous R language knowledge and a book by Jon Duckett. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research or creative projects. My B.S. is in Biology, specifically botany, entomology, and animal behavior. 
- 📫 How to reach me: cobrienstoffa@gmail.com
